# Housing Dataset Analysis

This repository provides a Python script for analyzing a housing dataset, including data inspection, statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the operations performed in the script.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from the file path:
```python
df = pd.read_csv("C://Users//bsind//Downloads//Housing.csv")
```
Ensure the file exists at the specified path or update the path to match the location of your dataset.

### 2. Data Inspection
The following operations are performed to inspect the data:
- Display the first five rows using `df.head()`.
- Check for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.
- Summarize the dataset structure, including data types and the number of rows/columns, using `df.info()`.

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics for numerical columns are generated using:
```python
basic_statistics = df.describe()
```
This provides metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for numeric columns.

### 4. Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix is computed for numeric columns using:
```python
correlation = df[numeric_columns].corr()
```
A heatmap is then created using Seaborn to visualize the relationships between variables:
```python
sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
```

### 5. Visualizations
The script creates three key visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data:

#### a. Scatter Plot: Price vs. Area
A scatter plot is generated to examine the relationship between property area and price, with markers styled by `furnishingstatus` and `airconditioning` availability.
```python
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="area", y="price", hue="furnishingstatus", style="airconditioning", palette="Set2")
```

#### b. Bar Plot: Number of Properties by Stories
A bar plot displays the distribution of properties based on the number of stories:
```python
sns.countplot(data=df, x="stories", palette="muted")
```

## Results and Insights
The visualizations reveal important insights:
- **Scatter Plot**: Larger properties tend to have higher prices, and furnishing status and air conditioning add value.
- **Bar Plot**: Two-story properties dominate the dataset, indicating a preference for this type of housing.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights relationships between numeric variables (e.g., area and price).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.
2. Save the dataset to the specified file path or update the script with the correct dataset location.
3. Run the script in your Python environment:
```bash
python housing_analysis.py
```

## Outputs
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays correlations between numeric variables.
- **Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between price and area.
- **Bar Plot**: Depicts the distribution of properties by the number of stories.

## Customization
- Update the file path in `pd.read_csv()` to match your dataset location.
- Modify visualizations to include additional features or explore different aspects of the dataset.

## Conclusion
This script provides a solid foundation for understanding and analyzing housing datasets. By extending the visualizations and statistical methods, you can gain deeper insights into housing market trends.
